# vip-workshop-2015-realtime

This is the repository for the socket.io server used in
@TooTallNate's talk for the Automattic VIP Workshop 2015.

Basically it's a demonstration of how you can add realtime
capabilities to your WordPress VIP installation, by having
the web browser connect to a Node.js socket.io server hosted
somewhere on your infrastructure.

In this particular example, we add realtime "presence"
capabilities. That is, how many other people are viewing
this post?
